/**
 * change log
 *
 * 21 Oct 14: 
 * Work started as a way to learn the basics of git as a VSS.  
 * Also hoping to consolidate different versions of this 
 * library into a relatively cohesive whole.  
 *
 * 19 Dec 2014:
 * Updating comments to set expectations.  This is still very 
 * much a work in progress.  One hampered, I'm afraid, by data 
 * loss through backup failure.  Ten years of personal and 
 * professional data *poof*.  If a hard drive fails in the 
 * archive, was there really a backup?  #heartbroken
 *
 * 16 Feb 2015:
 * New life on the project, sorta.  
 * -- Added jsdoc-style comments. 
 * -- Updated filename functions to handle trailing separators.
 * -- Updated TODOs throughout to reflect latest thinking.
 * -- Other fixes and tweaks.
 *
 * Feb - Apr 2015:
 * -- Assorted fixes and minor changes.
 * -- Started reworking default handlers.  Wish to simplify setup
      new projects.  Looking into RequireJS or AMD pattern.
 * -- Updated setTextHandler to optionally keep previous text.
 *
 * ?? ??? 15
 * -- Typo fixes
 * -- Reorganized functions categories for clarity and eventual
 *    separation.
 * -- Started work on a test harness.  Hope to evolve it into a
 *    test-driven development demo.  Ongoing concern.
