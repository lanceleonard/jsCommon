/**
 * change log
 *
 * 21 Oct 14: 
 * Using this library as a way to learn the basics of git as a VSS.  Also hoping to 
 * consolidate different versions of this library into a (relatively) cohesive whole.  
 *
 * 19 Dec 2014:
 * Updating comments to set expectations.  This is still very much a work in progress.
 * One hampered, I'm afraid, by data loss through backup failure.  Ten years of data gone.
 * If a hard drive fails in the cluster, was the data ever truly backed up?  #heartbroken
 *
 * 16 Feb 2015:
 * New life on the project, sorta.  
 * -- Added jsdoc-style comments. 
 * -- Bulked up file name functions to include options for trailing path separator.
 * -- Updated TODOs throughout existing functions to reflect latest thinking.
 * -- Other fixes and tweaks. 
 *
